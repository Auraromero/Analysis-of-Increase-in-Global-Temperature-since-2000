Analyzing Global Temperature Trends using SQL

In this project, we analyzed and processed data on global temperature trends since the year 2000 using SQL. Using a large dataset in a CSV file that contained temperature readings from various locations around the world.
We used SQL to clean and process the data, and then analyze it to identify trends and patterns in the temperature readings. Then we created visualizations in Tableau to help communicate findings

We identified a significant increase in global temperatures over the past two decades, with some regions experiencing more extreme temperature changes than others.
